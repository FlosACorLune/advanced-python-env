Nikolai wrote the is_alive(health) function, which checks the health of the character in
the game. If it is equal to or less than zero, the function returns False, otherwise True.
Unfortunately, the function does not work, because the student made a number of
mistakes in it. Fix them and check the functionality of the program (a number is
always passed as an argument).
